ENSBC is a fully functional binary calculator that operates on
files in ``ensemble'' file format.

To build, one simply types "make" and manually installs the binaries
"calc", "calcbc", and "ensbc".

For example, provided are files  filea, fileb, filec  in ensemble format.
One can do

% ensbc
foo = filea + fileb*filec^3
fred = filec / foo
calc(fred)
^D

The ensemble file format looks like

<#correlators> <time extent> <type 0=real, 1=complex> <space extent> <# columns>
0 5.0 1.0
1 5.1 1.01
...
<T-1> XXX XXX
0 5.01 1.01
1 5.2 1.2
...
<T-1> XXX XXX


So, the time-slice listed correlators are appended one after another.
